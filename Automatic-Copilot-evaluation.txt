AUTOMATIC COPILOT EVALUATION – TA GRADING REPORT
Repository: miguelvanegas-c/LinealRegression
Topic: Stellar Luminosity – Linear and Polynomial Regression from First Principles
================================================================================

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SUMMARY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The repository demonstrates a solid, mostly complete implementation of both
linear and polynomial regression from scratch. The student correctly applies
NumPy vectorization, implements gradient descent in both vectorized and
non-vectorized forms, produces the mandatory cost surface and convergence plots,
runs three learning-rate experiments, and carries out the required polynomial
feature-selection and interaction-coefficient experiments. Conceptual
understanding is adequately articulated throughout the notebooks. The main
weaknesses are: (1) the absence of any AWS SageMaker execution evidence in
the README, (2) the use of pandas (not an allowed library) for a cosmetic
DataFrame display in Notebook 2, (3) no explicit convergence plot in Notebook 2,
and (4) the inference demo in Notebook 2 uses hardcoded weight values instead of
the weights learned in the preceding training cell.

GRADING BREAKDOWN (0.0 – 5.0 scale)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Repository Structure & Compliance          0.40 / 0.50
   - README present: YES
   - Two notebooks present (Part I and Part II): YES
   - Datasets defined inside notebooks: YES
   - Only allowed libraries (Python, NumPy, Matplotlib): PARTIAL
     * Notebook 2 (cell 3) imports pandas for a DataFrame inspection display.
       pandas is not in the permitted library list. Usage is cosmetic only
       (data.head()) but still constitutes a constraint violation.
     Deduction: -0.10

2. Notebook 1 – Linear Regression             1.80 / 2.00
   - Dataset visualization and interpretation: YES. Scatter plot produced;
     correct observation that the relationship is non-linear and curved.
   - Hypothesis (predict) and MSE (compute_cost): YES. Both implemented
     correctly with clear formulas.
   - Cost surface (MANDATORY): YES. 3D surface plot over a w–b grid is
     present with a correct explanation of what the minimum represents.
   - Gradient derivation: YES. Both dJ/dw and dJ/db are derived and
     implemented.
   - Non-vectorized gradient descent: YES. Explicit loop over samples
     implemented; however, the final summation still delegates to np.sum
     rather than a pure Python accumulator loop, which is a minor
     inconsistency with "no loop over samples" intent.
   - Vectorized gradient descent: YES. Clean NumPy vectorization.
   - Convergence plot (MANDATORY): YES. Cost vs. iterations is plotted with
     a brief but adequate commentary on convergence behavior.
   - Multiple learning-rate experiments (≥3, MANDATORY): YES. Three rates
     tested (0.0001, 0.1, 0.59); divergence at the largest rate is correctly
     identified and explained.
   - Final fit plot and error discussion: YES. Regression line overlaid on
     scatter plot; systematic underfitting error noted.
   - Conceptual questions (meaning of w, limits of linearity): YES. Both
     addressed concisely and correctly.
   Deductions:
     * No per-learning-rate convergence plot (only final parameters reported
       for the three experiments): -0.10
     * The non-vectorized implementation partially delegates to np.sum instead
       of a fully manual loop: -0.05
     * Convergence commentary is minimal: -0.05

3. Notebook 2 – Polynomial Regression         1.60 / 2.00
   - Visualization with temperature encoding: YES. Scatter plot with plasma
     colormap encoding temperature.
   - Feature engineering [M, T, M², M·T]: YES. All four features are used
     in model M3; M1 uses [M, T], M2 uses [M, T, M²], M3 uses [M, T, M², M·T].
   - Vectorized loss and gradients: YES. Matrix operations used throughout.
   - Training and convergence plot: PARTIAL. Training loop present and cost
     history is tracked, but no convergence plot (cost vs. iterations) is
     rendered in Notebook 2. This is a notable omission.
   - Feature selection experiment – M1, M2, M3 comparison (MANDATORY): YES.
     All three models trained; predicted-vs-actual plots shown for each.
     However, no explicit numerical comparison of final losses across M1, M2,
     M3 is presented.
   - Interaction cost analysis – w_MT sweep (MANDATORY): YES. Clean sweep
     over w_MT with a well-explained plot and commentary on interaction
     importance.
   - Inference example and interpretation (MANDATORY): YES. A new star
     (M=1.3, T=6600) is evaluated, with correct normalization. However, the
     weights used in the inference cell are hardcoded literals rather than the
     variables learned in the preceding training cell, which is fragile and
     indicative of a copy-paste issue.
   Deductions:
     * Missing convergence plot in Notebook 2: -0.20
     * No explicit numerical loss comparison across M1/M2/M3: -0.10
     * Hardcoded weights in inference cell instead of trained variables: -0.10

4. Cloud Execution Evidence (SageMaker)        0.00 / 0.50
   - Description of SageMaker execution: NOT PRESENT
   - Screenshots of notebooks in SageMaker: NOT PRESENT
   - Screenshots of successful execution: NOT PRESENT
   - Screenshots of at least one plot: NOT PRESENT
   - Local vs. cloud comparison: NOT PRESENT
   The README documents the project thoroughly in terms of concepts and code,
   but contains zero evidence of execution on AWS SageMaker.
   Deduction: -0.50

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FINAL GRADE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Repository structure & compliance : 0.40 / 0.50
  Notebook 1 – Linear regression    : 1.80 / 2.00
  Notebook 2 – Polynomial regression: 1.60 / 2.00
  Cloud execution evidence           : 0.00 / 0.50
  ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
  TOTAL                              : 3.80 / 5.00

Final grade: 3.8 / 5.0   →   PASS  (minimum passing grade: 3.0 / 5.0)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
STRENGTHS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Complete mandatory items in Notebook 1: cost surface (3D), convergence plot,
  and three learning-rate experiments are all present and correctly executed.
- Both vectorized and non-vectorized gradient descent are implemented and
  timed, showing practical awareness of computational efficiency.
- Notebook 2 includes the full M1/M2/M3 feature progression as required,
  with predicted-vs-actual plots for each model.
- The w_MT interaction sweep is correctly implemented and well-explained,
  demonstrating understanding of feature interactions.
- Normalization is applied and its necessity is explained with reference to
  a failure observed without it (realistic iterative problem-solving).
- Dataset is entirely self-contained inside the notebooks as required.
- Conceptual answers (meaning of w, limits of linearity) are accurate and
  relevant.
- Code is well-structured and readable with clear function docstrings.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ISSUES & MISSING ELEMENTS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- NO AWS SageMaker evidence whatsoever (no screenshots, no description).
  This is the most significant gap and costs the full 0.5 cloud points.
- No convergence plot in Notebook 2 despite history being tracked.
- Pandas imported in Notebook 2, violating the "only NumPy and Matplotlib"
  constraint.
- Inference cell in Notebook 2 uses hardcoded weight literals instead of
  the trained model variables; if the model is retrained with different
  hyperparameters the inference result will be wrong.
- No numerical table or print statement explicitly comparing final losses
  of M1, M2, M3, making the comparison qualitative only.
- Learning-rate experiments in Notebook 1 do not include convergence plots
  per rate; only text descriptions of outcome are provided.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TA FEEDBACK TO STUDENT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Overall, this is a technically solid submission. The core implementations—
gradient descent, cost surface, polynomial feature engineering, and the
interaction sweep—are correct and well-presented. Your explanation of why
normalization was necessary (and what happened without it) is a good example
of reflective, iterative engineering work.

To strengthen the submission:

1. Add SageMaker evidence to the README immediately. This single item lost
   you the entire half-point for cloud execution. A screenshot of the opened
   notebook and at least one plot cell output in the SageMaker environment
   is sufficient. Add a short paragraph describing how execution on the cloud
   differed from running locally (e.g., instance type, any setup steps).

2. Add a convergence plot to Notebook 2. You already collect the cost history
   in 'cost_hist' — a two-line plt.plot call is all that is needed.

3. Use trained variables in the inference cell. Replace the hardcoded weights
   with the 'w_learned' and 'b_learned' variables from your last training
   block. This makes the notebook reproducible and avoids silent errors if
   hyperparameters change.

4. Remove the pandas import from Notebook 2. The DataFrame display is
   cosmetic; the same inspection can be done with a plain print statement and
   NumPy, keeping you within the allowed library set.

5. Consider adding a brief table comparing the final cost of M1, M2, and M3
   numerically to strengthen the feature-selection discussion.

AI-GENERATION ASSESSMENT  (NON-GRADING – informational only)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A. Qualitative Assessment

   Indicators suggesting AI assistance:
   - Function docstrings follow a uniform, professional NumPy-style format
     across both notebooks, which is uncommon in student homework.
   - Markdown explanations are clean, generic, and structurally parallel
     (each section ends with a brief, tidy summary sentence).
   - The README is written in polished, standardized technical prose with
     emoji section headers and a feature-comparison table—typical of
     AI-assisted documentation.
   - Explanation depth is uniform; no section shows notably deeper reasoning
     or personal struggle beyond what the prompt required.

   Indicators suggesting genuine human work:
   - The comment in Notebook 2 describing the initial failure without
     normalization ("the cost went to infinity and became undefined") reflects
     real iterative debugging rather than a scripted explanation.
   - The inference cell uses hardcoded weights—an error that AI would
     typically not introduce but a student working step-by-step might.
   - The non-vectorized implementation partially uses np.sum (a subtle
     inconsistency) rather than a textbook-perfect loop, suggesting a student
     adapting code rather than generating it from scratch.
   - The choice of the learning rate 0.59 (which causes divergence) and the
     observation about it suggest hands-on experimentation.

B. Quantitative Estimate

   Code (implementations, cells):     ~50% AI-assisted
   Explanations / markdown (cells):   ~65% AI-assisted
   README:                            ~75% AI-assisted

C. Commentary

   The project shows signs of a hybrid workflow: the student likely wrote or
   adapted the core algorithmic logic themselves (evidenced by real bugs and
   iterative fixes) while leaning on AI assistance for documentation,
   docstrings, and README structure. The uniform quality of written
   explanations contrasts with the uneven technical execution (missing plots,
   hardcoded weights), which is a common pattern when explanatory text is
   AI-generated but implementation is done manually.

   This assessment is observational and does not imply misconduct.
